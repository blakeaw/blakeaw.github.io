A paper that I'd been working on for quite a while (i.e., far too long) finally made it's way out as a peer-reviewed journal article in the <a href="https://www.cell.com/biophysj/issue?pii=S0006-3495(18)X0017-4">August 6th Issue of Biophysical Journal</a> (still the current issue at the moment).
The article is titled "Cardiolipin-Dependent Properties of Model Mitochondrial Membranes from Molecular Simulations" and it is available Open Access online (if you want to check it out): <a href="https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(19)30512-0" >https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(19)30512-0</a>. Needless to say, I breathed a sigh of relief and enjoyed a moment of jubilation when we got notice that our revised manuscript was accepted for publication.  We originally submitted the article to Biophysical Journal back in February; the preprint version that we submitted is available on bioRxiv [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/557744v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/557744v1). If you compare the final published version and the preprint, you will see that the article underwent a fairly extensive set of revisions.    

Shortly after the final revised manuscript was accepted for publication, my co-author Arvind Ramanathan suggested we submit a cover art entry. Everyone agreed, so I designed a cover art image that we ended up submitting. And to my surprise it was accepted! So the cover of the [August 6th issue of Biophysical Journal](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/issue?pii=S0006-3495(18)X0017-4) bears my cover art design. Pretty cool, if I say so myself! Here's the link to the accompanying cover art post on the BPS Blog if you want read more about it: [https://www.biophysics.org/blog/structure-and-dynamics-of-model-mitochondria-membranes-1](https://www.biophysics.org/blog/structure-and-dynamics-of-model-mitochondria-membranes-1).        

Well, that's all I have to say for now. Thanks for reading. Feel free to share this post with anyone who might be interested. And be sure to come back for future posts.

Until next time -- Blake
