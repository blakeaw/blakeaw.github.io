title: tBid, or not tBid?
subtitle: An apoptosis inspired re-imagining of a portion of the "To be, or not be" monologue
tags: [apoptosis, tBid, Shakespeare]

I originally wrote this re-imagining of the famous ["To be, or not to be" soliloquy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be,_or_not_to_be) (actually just a  portion it) from Shakespeare's Hamlet over a year ago (I was still in Nashville at the time). This new version I concocted is inspired by apoptosis, and in particular the process of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). At the time of writing it, I shared it with my lab mates and many of them seemed to like it, so when it recently popped in my head I decided I would go ahead and share it here on the blog. Here it goes:  

> tBid, or not tBid, that is the question:
> Whether 'tis nobler in the mitochondrion to suffer
> The slings and arrows of outrageous caspase activation,
> Or to take Arms against a Sea of pro-apoptotic proteins,
> And by opposing inhibit them: to die, to permeabilize
> No more; and by a permeabilization, to say we end
> the membrane-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
> that the Cell is heir to?

Well, that's it for now. Thanks for reading. Feel free to share this post with anyone who might be interested. And be sure to come back for future posts; you can follow and get updates to this blog via its RSS/Atom Feed.

Until next time -- Blake
