Recently, I've been learning about radioligand therapies (RLTs), a type of nuclear medicine used for targeted cancer therapy. With this post, I am compiling and sharing what I've learned as a resource for myself and others interested in this therapeutic technology. This post will be the first in a new series I'm calling <i>Exploring Precision Cancer Therapies</i>. I plan to highlight and discuss various targeted and precision cancer therapy approaches.

This post will be the first of two on RLTs. In it, we'll start with an overview of RLTs, covering what they are, how they work, what RLTs are currently available, and some of their challenges. Then, in the next post, we'll construct and explore a semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetics and receptor occupancy (PKRO) model of an RLT.

## What is Radioligand Therapy?

Radioligand therapy (RLT) is a type of targeted [nuclear medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/nuclear-medicine) that uses radioactive material for precision cancer therapy [[1](https://www.novartis.com/us-en/sites/novartis_us/files/rlt-manufacturing-factsheet.pdf)]. RLTs combine two key components: a targeting ligand and a radioisotope (or radionuclide) [[1](https://www.novartis.com/us-en/sites/novartis_us/files/rlt-manufacturing-factsheet.pdf), [2](https://www.novartis.com/research-and-development/technology-platforms/radioligand-therapy)].

![image](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1nducfnivswwCntrAWqIxH9HmDLWvl6yQ&sz=w200)

The targeting ligand selectively binds to a particular biomarker, like a receptor or antigen expressed by the cancer cells. When the radioisotope (or radionuclide) undergoes [radioactive decay](https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radioactive-decay), it emits a high-energy [ionizing radiation](https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-basics#ioniandnonioni) that damages nearby cells and tissue. This combination allows RLTs to selectively target the cancer cells expressing the targeted biomarker and release cell-damaging radiation in the local vicinity of the cancer.

As a precision approach, RLTs can target cancer cells throughout the body with limited damage to healthy cells and tissue, allowing them to be used effectively against even metastatic cancers.

## Currentlty Available RLTs

Currently, there are only a handful of FDA-approved RLTs. They include Zevalin&reg; (In-111 Ibritumomab Tiuxetan and Yt-90 Ibritumomab Tiuxetan), approved in 2002 for relapsed or refractory low-grade, follicular, or transformed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10905220/), [4](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2002/ibriide021902LB.pdf), [5](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2002/ibriide021902L.htm)]. However, it is rarely used now [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10905220/)]. Progenics Pharmaceuticals (now [Lantheus](https://www.lantheus.com/)) received FDA approval for Azedra&reg; (I-131 Iobenguane) in 2018 for the treatment of advanced or metastatic pheochromocytoma or
paraganglioma [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10905220/), [6](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=209607), [7](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2018/209607s000lbl.pdf)]. And, most recently, there are Pluvicto&reg; (Lu-177 vipivotide tetraxetan) developed by [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/) and approved in 2022 [[8](https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-pluvictotm-approved-fda-first-targeted-radioligand-therapy-treatment-progressive-psma-positive-metastatic-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer), [9](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=215833), [10](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chrisdesavi_medicine-pharmaceuticals-healthcare-activity-6984569645236162560-Ezz1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)] and Lutathera&reg; (Lu-177 Dotatate) aquired by Novartis and FDA approved earlier this year (2024) [[11](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=208700), [12](https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-radioligand-therapy-lutathera-fda-approved-first-medicine-specifically-pediatric-patients-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors), [13](https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-announces-planned-acquisition-advanced-accelerator-applications-strengthen-oncology-portfolio)], for treatment of metastatic prostate-specific membrane antigenâ€“positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (PSMA+ mCRPC) and pediatric somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (SSTR+ GEP-NETs), respectively.

Although the number of FDA-approved RLTs is currently limited, this treatment technology is still being developed. For example, [The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/) announced a strategic collaboration earlier this year to co-develop a new radioligand [[14](https://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/md-anderson-c-biomex-co-develop-radioligand-therapy.h00-159695178.html)], CBT-001, that targets the CA9 (carbonic anhydrase 9) cancer biomarker overexpressed in various cancers. 

## Some Current Challenges of RLTs

RLTs rely on radioisotopes with a relatively short [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life) (time it takes for 50% of the radisotope to decay), typically on the order of a week or less.

| Radioisotope | Half-life |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Indium-111   | 2.81 days [[4](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2002/ibriide021902LB.pdf)] |
| Yttrium-90   |  2.67 days [[4](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2002/ibriide021902LB.pdf)]         |
| Iodine-131   |  8.201 days [[7](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2018/209607s000lbl.pdf)] |
| Lutetium-177 |  6.647 days [[15](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2022/215833s000lbl.pdf)] |
| | |

A short half-life helps limit the time it takes for radioactivity to abate in a patient after RLT administration. However, this presents a unique logistical challenge in that the RLT must be produced, shipped, and administered to patients within days to avoid significant reductions in the therapeutic strength of the drug [[16](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/11/radioligand-cancer-therapy-forces-manufacturers-to-race-the-clock.html)]. 

Another major challenge of RLTs is their cost [[16](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/11/radioligand-cancer-therapy-forces-manufacturers-to-race-the-clock.html)]. For example, Novartis' Pluvicto&reg; RLT has a list price in the U.S. of around $42,500 per unit [[16](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/11/radioligand-cancer-therapy-forces-manufacturers-to-race-the-clock.html)], with a total per patient treatment cost of approximately $122,489 as estimated by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health [[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK596311/)]. The average unit price in U.S. may be even higher at around $47,939 [[18](https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/pluvicto)]. Initial biomarker testing  also adds significantly to the overall costs associated with the treatment [[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK596311/)].       

Another potential challenge is patient and clinician access to RLTs, as many treatment centers may not have the infrastructure to deliver the therapy [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10905220/), [19](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/novartis_preparing-hcs-for-rlt-activity-7242502774683279360-Y-mL?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)]. The limited number of active RLT manufacturing facilities may also make access more difficult due to the logistical challenges of delivering RLTs' within their short time window of viability .

It's possible that as companies like Novartis continue to invest in RLT and expand their manufacturing and supply capabilities [[20](https://www.novartis.com/us-en/news/media-releases/novartis-begins-construction-two-new-radioligand-therapy-facilities-us-expanding-its-world-class-rlt-manufacturing-and-supply-network), [21](https://www.novartis.com/research-and-development/technology-platforms/radioligand-therapy/supporting-healthcare-system-readiness-rlt?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=EsmoEanm2024&utm_content=video-global-post2)], these challenges may become less significant over time.  


## Closing Thoughts

In this post, we covered some basics of Radioligand Therapy (RLT), including what they are, how they work, what RLTs are currently available, and some associated challenges. RLTs are an exciting avenue of precision cancer therapy, combining biomarker targeting with radioactivity to apply cytotoxic radiation to cancer cells selectively. Although the number of FDA-approved RLTs is currently limited, and there are still some significant challenges associated with this treatment approach, RLTs remain an active area of development in the continued expansion of our arsenal of cancer therapeutics.
