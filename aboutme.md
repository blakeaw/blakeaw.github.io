## Bio
Hey there, Iâ€™m Blake - a computational scientist and <span style="color:green">*tea drinker*</span>.


I received my BS in Chemistry from The University of Texas at Tyler with a minor in Physics. As a first-generation college student, I had the opportunity to participate in undergraduate research through the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. That seminal experience introduced me to academic research and ultimately lead to me deciding to go on to graduate school to pursue research as the next step in my journey. <span style="color:green">*(I would occasionally have some tea to get a caffeine boost.)*</span>

I then obtained my PhD in Chemistry from The University of Texas at Dallas under the advisement of Steven O. Nielsen, which set me up with a solid foundation in theoretical/computational physical chemistry. <span style="color:green"> *(This was the time where the seeds of tea drinking started to take root and began to sprout.)*</span>

Afterward, I went on to do postdoctoral work at Vanderbilt University under the supervision of Carlos F. Lopez, which provided me with new experience in computational systems biology. <span style="color:green"> *(It was during this period that my passion for tea really began to blossom.)*</span>

After finishing my postdoc at Vanderbilt I then moved back to the Dallas area and worked briefly as an independent contractor developing a research software tool to train and compare biological models of cell signaling pathways. During this time I also ended up taking a part-time research position in the [Nano-Thermal Bioengineering Lab](https://www.nanobrainlab.net/) at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/), which ultimately lead to a full-time postdoc appointment. <span style="color:green"> *(Since my work was only part-time I really had time to enjoy my tea sessions, which then allowed me to delve even more into the practice of Gong Fu brewing.)*</span>

Currently, I am working as a post-doctoral Research Associate in the [Nano-Thermal Bioengineering Lab](https://www.nanobrainlab.net/) at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. Zhenpeng Qin.  <span style="color:green"> *(I'm still exploring the world of tea, and I squeeze in some time every now and again to savor my brews.)*</span>

## Other Interests

I'm an avid tea drinker (as you probably already gathered), so much so that I run a separate blog dedicated to my tea enthusiam: [Blake's Tea Journal](https://blakesteajournal.blog).

I also dabble in the arts. The ones that have stuck the most are soft pastels and pencil/charcoal sketching.
