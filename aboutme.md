Hi! I’m the Blake behind this site. I’m an experienced researcher with a background in computational sciences, including molecular simulation and systems biology; for more details about my academic history check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ho-T9pX_E52hr6Z-xWw8n2HFYGoYO9we/view?usp=sharing). I have experience developing software (Python, C/C++) and scripts (Bash, Tcl) for computational research, as well as experience running simulations and analysis in HPC settings such as [TACC](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/), [OLCF](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/), and [ACCRE](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/accre/); see the next section for a more detailed list of my skills and experience.


### Other Interests

I'm an avid tea drinker with a dedicated [tea blog](blakesteajournal.blog) where I post tasting notes and other tea infused content, as well as an accompanying [Zazzle store](https://www.zazzle.com/store/blakesteajournalblog) where I sell my tea themed designs.
