Hi! I’m the Blake behind this site. I’m an experienced researcher with a background in computational sciences, including molecular simulation and systems biology; for more details about my academic history check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ho-T9pX_E52hr6Z-xWw8n2HFYGoYO9we/view?usp=sharing). I also have experience developing software (Python, C/C++) and scripts (Bash, Tcl) for computational research, as well as experience running simulations and analysis in HPC settings such as [TACC](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) and [OLCF](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/).


### Other Interests

I'm an avid tea drinker with a blog, [Blake's Tea Journal](blakesteajournal.blog), dedicated to tea and tea-related content; I also have an accompanying [Zazzle store](https://www.zazzle.com/store/blakesteajournalblog) where I sell my tea themed designs.
