Hey there, Iâ€™m Blake - a computational scientist, programmer, and tea drinker.

I received my BS in Chemistry from The University of Texas at Tyler. <span style="color:green">*(I would occasionally have some tea to get a caffeine boost.)*</span>

Afterward, I obtained my PhD in Chemistry from The University of Texas at Dallas under the advisement of Steven O. Nielsen, which set me up with a solid foundation in theoretical/computational physical chemistry. <span style="color:green"> *(This was the time where the seeds of tea drinking started to take root and began to sprout.)* text</span>

I then went on to do postdoctoral work under the supervision of Carlos F. Lopez, which provided me with new experience in computational systems biology. <span style="color:green"> *(It was during this period that my passion for tea really began to blossom.)*</span>

Right now, I'm working as a part-time (post-doctoral) Research Associate in the [Nano-Thermal Bioengineering Lab](https://openwetware.org/wiki/Qin) at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) on a project using molecular dynamics simulation and finite element modeling to help understand the photothermal dynamics of [molecular hyperthermia](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smll.201700841). <span style="color:green"> *(I'm still exploring the world of tea, and I've been enjoying the extra free time to really savor my brews.)*</span>

### Other Interests

I'm an avid tea drinker (as you probably already gathered), so much so that I run a separate blog dedicated to my tea enthusiam: [Blake's Tea Journal](https://blakesteajournal.blog).

I also dabble in the arts. The ones that have stuck the most are soft pastels and pencil/charcoal sketching. My art interest also also feeds back into my tea addiction through my tea blog's accompanying Zazzle store where I post tea themed designs: <a href="https://www.zazzle.com/store/blakesteajournalblog?rf=238578075608592982&tc=PersonalSite" rel="nofollow">BlakesTeaJournalBlog</a>
