# About Me

**Hey there, Iâ€™m Blake - an experienced computational researcher with a penchant for tea.**


## Educational Journey

### The Undergrad Years

I started my educational journey at The University of Texas at Tyler, earning my BS in Chemistry with a minor in Physics. As a first-generation college student, I had to navigate uncertain waters, sometimes not so successfully. However, it turned out to be formative experience, and, in particular, my experience as undergraduate researcher ultimately lead to my pursuit of a PhD. When I first started college, I never imagined this would be the route I'd end up taking.

### To PhD

My journey continued at The Univeristy of Texas at Dallas, where I earned my PhD in Chemistry under the guidance of Dr. Steven O. Nielsen in the Molecular Simulation Lab. Specialing in theoretical and computational physical chemistry, I developed expertise in molecular simulation and free energy methods.

During the final summer of my PhD education, I had the opportunity to do research at Oak Ridge National Lab through the Advanced Short-Term Research Opportunity (ASTRO) program. This was a great learning experience, further cultivating my interest in high-performance computing.  

I completed my degree in absentia in August of 2016. 

## The Beyond

### Postdoc Chapter 1

After completing my PhD, I went on to do postdoctoral research at Vanderbilt University in Dr. Carlos F. Lopez's lab. There, I was introduced to computational systems biology, and delved into mechanistic and multiscale modeling approaches to cancer biology.

### Short stint as an Independent Contractor

Once my tenure as a postdoc at Vanderbilt was over, I continued working part-time with the Lopez lab as an independent contractor, focusing on software tool development with applications to dynamical modeling of apoptosis signaling pathways. 

### Postdoc Chapter 2

At that time, I was back in the Dallas area, so I reconnected with my PhD advisor, Dr. Nielsen. He introduced me to Dr. Zhenpeng Qin who leads the NanoBioengineering Lab at UT Dallas. Dr. Qin was gracious enough to hire me in a part-time research role focused on resolving some discrepancies between atomistic simulations and finite-element models of gold nanoparticle interface heat transfer. After several months, I was eventually offered a full-time postdoctoral research position, and I continued working in the NanoBioengineering Lab until earlier this year. While there, I used my computational skills to help advance the lab's research in areas of molecular hyperthermia and neuropeptide volume transmission (in the brain) while contributing to other projects on an ad hoc basis.

### Current Chapter

I am currently exploring new career opportunities that leverage my expertise in computational research and my passion for scientific computing. 

## Other Interests

### Tea Along the Way

From occasional sips for a caffein boost to a more mindful practice of Gong Fu brewing, my love of tea has grown alongside my academic and professional journey. Tea serves as source of comfort and calm amid the rigors work and daily life, helping me recover focus, destress, and inject a little more mindfulness into my life.

### Hiking

As a kid growing up in rural East Texas, I was no stranger to wandering through the woods, often armed with a pocket knife, machete, and make-shift walking stick. I always enjoyed getting a little lost amongst the trees, forging new trails, and finding ways to cross the creeks. In the final year or year and a half while in Tennessee for my first postdoc at Vanderbilt, I rediscovered a love of hiking and made it a regular part of my weekends. After moving back to the Dallas area though, hiking went to the wayside for a while. However, I recently rediscovered (again) the joy and solace of a good hike. Along with tea, hiking also helps me recover and improve my well-being.  

I'm currenlty making an effort to visit various Texas State Parks and day hike their trails. I'm also participating in the 52 Hike Challenge, which I started back in June.

### Reading 

I enjoy reading fiction, incuding science-fiction, fantasy, and detective stories. I've been particularly into Sherlock Holmes over the past few years, reading the full Conan Doyle canon and many pastiches in the extended world of Holmes fiction. However, I recently ventured into the world of Poirot (Agatha Christie) to further explore the wider world of detective fiction. 

### Art 

I also dabble in the arts, and particularly enjoy pencil/charcoal sketching and soft pastel painting.
