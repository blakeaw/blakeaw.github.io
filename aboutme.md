Hi! I’m the Blake behind this site. I’m an experienced researcher with experience in molecular simulation and systems biology. I’ve also have experience developing scientific software (Python, C/C++, Bash) for use in computational research. If you want learn more about my academic history then check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ho-T9pX_E52hr6Z-xWw8n2HFYGoYO9we/view?usp=sharing).

### Other Interests

I'm an avid tea drinker with a dedicated [tea blog](blakesteajournal.blog) where I post tasting notes and other tea infused content, as well as an accompanying [Zazzle store](https://www.zazzle.com/store/blakesteajournalblog) where I sell my tea themed designs.
