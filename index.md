## Welcome

Hey there, Iâ€™m Blake - a computational research scientist with experience building models, running simulations, and performing data analysis across areas of physical chemistry, systems biology, and nano-bioengineering. I have a penchant for computational methods and programming, so I like building new computational tools. I also drink a lot of tea!  

I recently completed a term as a (postdoctoral) Research Associate in the [NanoBioengineering Lab](https://www.nanobrainlab.net/) at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/). While there I provided computational support including modeling and data analysis to a variety of projects in the lab, but my principal focus was on studying [molecular hyperthermia](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smll.201700841) and diffusion in the brain extracellular space. I used a variety of modeling and simulation methods including molecular dynamics simulation, rules-based ODE models, and reaction-diffusion modeling along with data and image analysis methods to help better understand and characterize these phenomena.

Currently, I'm looking for new career opportunities in _i)_ research support and high-performance computing or _ii)_ pharma and drug discovery.
