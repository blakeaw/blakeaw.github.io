## Welcome

Hey there! Iâ€™m Blake, a computational research scientist with a penchant for tea. I have a background in computational physical chemistry with additional postdoctoral experience in cancer systems biology and nano-bioengineering. My expertise includes molecular simulation and encompasses molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and free energy simulation methods. In addition to my molecular simulation skills, I have experience with differential equation-based reaction-diffusion and reaction network models of chemical and biological systems, such as cellular signaling processes; my skillset in this domain also includes parameter estimation using stochastic optimization and Bayesian inference methods, as well as model selection, information theoretics, and dynamical model analysis. I'm also proficient with Linux/UNIX systems, Bash scripting, and Python programming (with a background in C++), and I have extensive experience utilizing high-performance computing environments.

Want learn more? Check out the [About Me](https://blakeaw.github.io/aboutme/) section for a deeper dive into my academic and professional journey. 

Interested in my skills and experience - let's connect! I am currently exploring new career opportunities that could leverage my experience in research and skills in scientific computing, and I'd be happy to discuss how I can contribute to your team. See the [Contact](https://blakeaw.github.io/contact/) page for ways to get in touch.
