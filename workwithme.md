# Research Collaborations

I'm always open to forming research collaborations, so feel free to contact me if you are interested in working together or if you think I might be able to help you with a research problem (see the icons at the bottom of the page for links to my various profiles as well as my email). I'm currently working as a (postdoctoral) Research Associate in the [Nano-Thermal Bioengineering Lab](https://openwetware.org/wiki/Qin) at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/).
