# Research Collaborations

I'm always open to forming research collaborations, so feel free to contact me if you are interested in working together or if you think I might be able to help you with a research problem (see the icons at the bottom of the page for links to my various profiles as well as my email).

# Freelance/Contract

Since my current research position is only part-time, I would consider accepting additional small jobs on a freelance/contract basis. Here are some things I might be able to help you with:
  * scientific/research software development (e.g., to perform data analysis)
  * manuscript editing (e.g., content and/or writing of research journal articles. This could be particularly useful for grad students or post-docs with English as a second language.)
  * logo design

If youâ€™re interested in commissioning one of the above services or want to discuss other ways how I might be able to help you, feel free to get in touch (see the icons at the bottom of the page for links to my various profiles as well as my email).
