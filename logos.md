## Details for Each Logo

#### PyBILT logo<a name="pybilt"></a>

[<img width="200" height="200" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoLab-VU/PyBILT/master/_images/PyBILT_logo.png">](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/PyBILT)

* **Designed For:** [PyBILT software](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/PyBILT)
* **Status:** In use

##### About:
The logo consists of three lipid bilayer sketches with corresponding data plot sketches, representing the fact that PyBILT was developed to analyze trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayer systems. For this logo, I drew the core bilayers and graphs image by hand using marker and paper. I then made a digital scan and using the Gimp software, I cleaned up/touched up the image and added the logo text. This was first foray into logo design/making.   

#### Gleipnir logo<a name="gleipnir"></a>

[<img width="100" height="100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoLab-VU/Gleipnir/master/images/gleipnir_logo_2.png">](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/Gleipnir)

* **Designed For:** [Gleipnir software](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/Gleipnir)
* **Status:** In use

##### About:
 The name Gleipnir used for this software was taken from Norse mythology. In that, Gleipnir is a magical rope/chain that was forged by the dwarves and used to bind the mighty wolf Fenris (sometimes Fenrir). The logo highlights this mythological connection by overlaying a wolf-head icon over that of a rope. The font of the logo text was chosen to further a sort of heavy metal vibe. This relatively simple logo design was created using the logo editor at [https://www.freelogodesign.org/](https://www.freelogodesign.org/)

#### GAlibrate logo<a name="galibrate"></a>

 [<img width="200" height="200" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blakeaw/GAlibrate/master/images/GAlibrate_logo.png">](https://github.com/blakeaw/GAlibrate)

 * **Designed For:** [GAlibrate software](https://github.com/blakeaw/GAlibrate)
 * **Status:** In use

##### About:
 The GAlibrate software implements a genetic algorithm-based optimization, which the logo embodies by the use of the monosomes and descent tree iconography. And the logo includes the name "GAlibrate" with stylistic coloring used to highlight the "G" and "A" (which stand for Genetic Algorithm) with color blocks (another font type) that match the colors of the two monosomes, while the "librate" portion matches the descent tree. This logo design was created using the logo editor at https://www.freelogodesign.org/

#### simplePSO logo<a name="simplepso"></a>

 [<img width="200" height="200" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mQBnlbXzFkAZcTzLg12E7iFz6xhbUYFz"> ](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/ParticleSwarmOptimization)

 * **Designed For:** [simplePSO software](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/ParticleSwarmOptimization)
 * **Status:** Not yet in use

##### About:
 The simplePSO software implements particle swarm optimization. The logo embodies this with a sketch of a mountain-like 'cost' landscape and a swarm cloud that is swarming to the peak (i.e., the optimum) of the landscape. The design includes both the software name and z tagline; this is the first of my logo designs to include a tagline. This logo design was created using the online version of the digital sketchpad, aptly named Sketchpad, at https://sketch.io/

#### HypBuilder logo<a name="hypbuilder"></a>

 [<img width="200" height="200" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1iTJ8OHkLYioxRmiBCZ0XTk4KUAYi_vLu"> ](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/HypBuilder)

 * **Designed For:** [HypBuilder software](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/HypBuilder)
 * **Status:** Not yet in use

##### About:
 The HypBuilder software allows users to encode variant hypotheses for systems biology models, and the software constructs PySB models for each of the hypotheses. The logo embodies this with a hammer acting on a network which represent the building of a hypothetical model. The design includes both the software name and a tagline. This logo design was created using the online version of the digital sketchpad, aptly named Sketchpad, at https://sketch.io/

#### MAGINE logo<a name="hypbuilder"></a>

 [<img width="300" height="300" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Krx_iPvQQZdZ1ZWfJQg27Xze58bkKbhu"> ](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/MAGINE)

 * **Designed For:** [MAGINE software](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/MAGINE)
 * **Status:** Not yet in use

##### About:
 The MAGINE software allows users to analyze large-scale multi-omics data and construct biological networks and extract mechanisms of action. The logo prominently features the MAGINE name but I chose to deviate from the standard brand name at the bottom and placed it along the vertical axis with offset lettering, including the expanded MAGINE acronym text. The paint spatter imagery on the right (blue) represents the massive hairball networks that can be generated by MAGINE. The design also includes a tagline for the software. This logo design was created using the online version of the digital sketchpad, aptly named Sketchpad, at https://sketch.io/
