* **Type:** Scientific/Research Software
* **Language:** Python
* **GitHub Repo:** [LoLab-VU/Gleipnir](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/Gleipnir)
* [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3743840.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3743840)

###### Description
Gleipnir is a python toolkit that provides an easy to use interface for Bayesian parameter inference and model selection using Nested Sampling. It has a built-in implementation of the classic Nested Sampling algorithm but also provides a common interface to the Nested Sampling implementations MultiNest, PolyChord, dyPolyChord, DNest4, and Nestle.

#### BioComparator

* **Type:** Scientific/Research Software
* **Language:** Python
* **GitHub Repo:** [LoLab-VU/BioComparator](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/BioComparator)

###### Description
BioComparator is a Python utility for comparing biological models encoded with [PySB](http://pysbdev.lolab.xyz/). BioComparator fits candidate models to a common data set and provides users with a set of comparative metrics that allows them to evaluate the models' fit to the data and the trade offs between the fit to data and model size/complexity.

###### Description
**ObjectiveLearner** is a python module that provides functionality to run [Supervised Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Supervised_learning) (linear regression) and [Sensitivity Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis#Regression_analysis) on the objective function versus parameter relationship using the thousands (to millions) of (sometimes expensive) objective function evaluations performed during model calibration with packages like [PyDREAM](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/PyDREAM), [simplePSO](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/ParticleSwarmOptimization), [Gleipnir](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/Gleipnir), and [GAlibrate](https://github.com/blakeaw/GAlibrate).

#### Bash Adventure

* **Type:** Text-based RPG (just for fun)
* **Language:** Bash
* **GitHub Repo:** [blakeaw/BashAdventure](https://github.com/blakeaw/BashAdventure)

###### Description
Bash Adventure is a short and simple text-based RPG style game written in Bash script that you can play in the terminal. Although I've yet to get around to smoothing out some of the rough edges (hard to believe it's been several years since I wrote the game), it should still provide a few minutes (maybe like 5 to 10 or so) of classic text-based gaming entertainment.
