* **Type:** Scientific/Research Software
* **Language:** Python
* **Contribution Level:** Principal Developer

Gleipnir is a python toolkit that provides an easy to use interface for Bayesian parameter inference and model selection using Nested Sampling. It has a built-in implementation of the classic Nested Sampling algorithm but also provides a common interface to the Nested Sampling implementations MultiNest, PolyChord, dyPolyChord, DNest4, and Nestle. https://github.com/LoLab-VU/Gleipnir

* **Type:** Scientific/Research Software
* **Language:** Python
* **Contribution Level:** Principal Developer

GAlibrate is a python toolkit that provides an easy to use interface for model calibration/parameter estimation using an implementation of continuous genetic algorithm-based optimization. https://github.com/blakeaw/GAlibrate

#### Bash Adventure

* **Type:** Text-based RPG (just for fun)
* **Language:** Bash
* **Contribution Level:** Principal Developer

Bash Adventure is a short and simple text-based RPG style game written in Bash script that you can play in the terminal. Although I've yet to get around to smoothing out some of the rough edges (hard to believe it's been several years since I wrote the game), it should still provide a few minutes (maybe like 5 to 10 or so) of classic text-based gaming entertainment. https://github.com/blakeaw/BashAdventure
